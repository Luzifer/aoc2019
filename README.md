This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

To execute them just use the tests for the respective day:

```console
# go test -v day01.go day01_test.go
=== RUN   TestCalculateDay1_Examples
--- PASS: TestCalculateDay1_Examples (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestCalculateDay1_Part1
--- PASS: TestCalculateDay1_Part1 (0.00s)
    day01_test.go:34: Solution Day 1 Part 1: 3126794
=== RUN   TestCalculateDay1_Part2
--- PASS: TestCalculateDay1_Part2 (0.00s)
    day01_test.go:43: Solution Day 1 Part 2: 4687331
